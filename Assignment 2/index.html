              There once was a young monkey named Harrison. Harrison grew up with another pet named Casey and 
              was a German Shepard. They are roughly the same age and they play together everyday.

            <p class="center">The day came where Casey and Harrison had to take on the meanest and toughest bull. Just as Casey and Harrison touched the bowl at the same time, their souls changed! Since then, the shepherd dog has become the soul of the monkey, and the body of the monkey has become a dog.
